## Repositories

We have a series of repositories for our work. We have adopted the naming convention of starting each repo with `hmpps-book-secure-move-`. Where some repos have a similar purpose we try to name them similarly, (e.g. `hmpps-book-secure-move-docs-*` for documentation modules). We also try to [name things](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/standards/naming-things/#naming-things) so that users can infer a basic understanding of what a given thing does from its name.

Each repository will be tagged with the topic `book-secure-move`, and discoverable via [this search](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Abook-secure-move+org%3Aministryofjustice).
